# Lacuna Software OTP Challenge
## Running the API
Hi! This is the code I produced to try to break the _One Time Pad_ challenge by Lacuna Software. There is an API that may be run with the commands (considering that your current working directory is the base folder of this project)

$ dotnet restore  
$ cd Lacuna.Api  
$ dotnet watch run  

This will give an output that indicates which port is running the API. Then, to make requests, use the address "localhost:port".

## Documentation
A very simple but useful Swagger UI maybe accessed in localhost:port/swagger once the server is running. This will help you to use the API!
